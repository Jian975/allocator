3	            ;initialize allocator to 3 bytes, must be first line
m a 10	        ;allocate 10 bytes and store it in a (m for malloc)
f a		        ;deallocate a (f for free)
p	    	    ;print the memory list (p for print)
g a             ;print value of a (g for get)
s a 3		    ;a=3. Undefined behavior if a doesn’t have enough space. Only supports ints (s for set)

We only allow 26 variables a-z. This is statically set
